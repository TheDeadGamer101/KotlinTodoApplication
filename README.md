# KotlinTodoApplication
A simple Todo app for android. Can add, remove and mark done Tasks them. 
Saves and loads the tasks from prefered storage using deprecated methods for now.
<br>
<br>
Made with Kotlin.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
For running, compiling android studio is needed.
<br>
Uses Android 8 as it's base. Works with newer android versions but I don't know if it works with older version. Haven't tested yet.
<br>
<br>
Gson is also used in the project. It is a package from google. Is already imported into Gradle. If needed to import it then put it into gradle.build insert into the dependencies section
<code>implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:version'</code>
<br>
<br>
Currently uses some deprecated classes and functions. Will replace them later on if problems arise.
